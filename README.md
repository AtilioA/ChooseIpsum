# ‚Ñπ About

This is a Lorem Ipsum generator made with ReactJS. It is inspired by [Trainspotting's Choose Life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fsk2IU9JQZ0) and was a constructive small project to learn React on my own.

The application is composed by a RESTful API made with Express and a website running React.
